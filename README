This is the completed project in my React Beginner Course. It's a Movie App based on The Movie Database API.

Clone or download the files and do the following:

1. Navigate into the folder

2. Install dependencies by typing `npm install``

3. Run the App by typing `npm start` (If it says something about updating for latest browser versions, select Yes)

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/ in you browser and watch the magic!
